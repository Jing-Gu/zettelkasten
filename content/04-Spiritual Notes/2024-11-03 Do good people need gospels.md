Jesus mentioned the hell will be populated with many good people. There’s no good people as everyone is full of sin. Even the “good people” who do everything right (like Cornelius, devout, god-fearing, give generously, pray to God), he will have to accept Jesus, “everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
