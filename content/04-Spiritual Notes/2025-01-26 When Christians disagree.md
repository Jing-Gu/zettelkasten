Godly disciples often can disagree, but love is the mark to see. People can depart for a period of time, but the reconciliation should always be the long term goal.


Proverbs 16:9

**The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps.**

God gives what is needed just for the day, just like manna wasn't given all in once. Today my grace is sufficient for you.

That's called **walking by faith**.
