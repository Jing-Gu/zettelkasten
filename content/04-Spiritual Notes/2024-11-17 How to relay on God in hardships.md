#Prayer 

**So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.** (Acts 12:5 NIV)

Earnestly praying, persistently praying, even in the hardships.

But we might wonder, James must also be praying, but James was killed Peter was saved, we may always have this kind of why, but those questions belong to the category of mystery, only God knows it. We just need to know that God always has his best plan on us, God always has the last word, because you see, the last verse: **But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.** (Acts 12:24 NIV)

Act 12 starts by:

- King Herod in power with a voice of God
- James killed
- Peter imprisoned
- But the church was fervently praying to God

Act 12 ends with:

- King Herod struck dead by an angel
- Prayers answered with Peter freed
- Word of God continues to spread and flourishing
