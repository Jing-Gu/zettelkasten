**Romans 14**

> If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you're no longer acting in love. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the holy spirit. Everything that doesn't come from faith is sin.

**Being right is not the same as being righteousness.**

It doesn't matter that you're right, but if your action is a stumbling block to others then you are not acting out of love. In this case, you might be doing right, but not doing righteously.

Love is the fulfilment of the law.

_Thought: Romans talks many times of righteousness_
