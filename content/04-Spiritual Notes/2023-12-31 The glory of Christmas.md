You probably give gifts to family and friends, but what did you give to Jesus? You can give him your sins, repent, that's how everything begins, or give your trust, that how to build better relationships with Jesus.

Often being asked or self asked new year Todos, people say “I want to try new things, learn new skills, better financial situations, lose weight, etc” Notice that lots of them are about resolution but few think about relation, such as getting a better relation with my kids, caring more for my husband, mostly building better relation with Jesus.
