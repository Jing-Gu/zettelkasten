Paul was condemned to death by Jews, put to prison, in chains, he was treated unfairly in a great suffering, however there was never bitterness in him, he was in peace, and that was from holy spirit, only God's spirit can give someone true inner peace.

Peace of God -> [[2024-12-01 Who is this child]]

That's the same spirit for him and us, in whichever situation, even the hardest one (Can we have bigger suffering than Paul?), we can have peace from God.  And God knows suffering, Jesus himself experienced the suffering.

Paul always wanted to preach in Rome, and eventually he made it, in chains. All the unjust suffering made him appeal to Cesar, travel to Rome. Later in book of Philippians, we see **Paul's chains advance the Gospel**, "what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel".
