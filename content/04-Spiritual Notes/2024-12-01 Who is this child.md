Today is the first Sunday Communion, I remember one message: 

The salvation is free, but not cheap.

For to us a child is born, 
to us a son is given, 
and the government will be on his shoulders. 
And he will be called 
Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, 
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
(Isaiah 9:6 NIV)

That's what I need the most: peace of God.

Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the **peace of God**, which transcends all understanding, will **guard your hearts and your minds** in Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:6-7 NIV)

I just feel “do not be anxious” matches me perfectly for my current struggle: cdpq offer and Sully non-sollicitation agreement, may God guides me and I shall work in peace.
