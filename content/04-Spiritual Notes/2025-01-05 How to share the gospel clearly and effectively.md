Have you thought of being a preacher? Not many people, but you don't need to be a preacher to preach, everyone every day is preaching his life to someone else.

We can't live up to the law, the law is good, and it's just like x-ray that can scan to show us where are the problems, but x-ray itself cannot solve the problems.

After being dispelled from the region, Paul and Barnabas left, but “Filled with joy and with the holy Spirit”. (Act 13:52).

To be with Jesus, you will have what the world wants the most: joy.
