#Prayer #Parenting 

A fun fact told by pastor, biblical suggestion to husbands if they want a happy marriage, then stop making themselves happy, make your wife happy then you will be happy, guess the happy wife happy life is universally true.

This society's value is eroding our children with 4 worldly views: 
- Humanism (human-centred not god-centred), 
- Materialism, 
- Hedonism (live up to the moment), 
- Relativism (no absolute wrong or right)

However Psalm 127 says: **Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.** So God is indeed the centre of our life.

*Children are a heritage from Lord*
As in Deuteronomy 6:7, wisdom for parents are: talking about God's words when you're  at home, on the road, going to bed, and getting up.
