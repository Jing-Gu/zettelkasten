Chapter 10 The investor and his advisors

Despite of different types of financial advisors, the question is do you need help? If yes, trust then verify, but the reality is no real good advisor will take you if you have less than $100,000 to invest.

Who is your enemy? Your advisor should protect you from your worst enemy - yourself. You hire an advisor not to manage your money but to manage you.
