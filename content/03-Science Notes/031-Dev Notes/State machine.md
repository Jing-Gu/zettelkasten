#Software 

First think about designing the **behavior** of a system, and only then thinking about designing the **mechanism** -- the system’s internal structure. 

State machines are a powerful tool for designing software that is both efficient and user-friendly. By breaking down complex processes into smaller, more manageable states, state machines can simplify user interfaces, improve the user experience, and reduce bugs and errors.

## What is state machine?

A state machine is a mathematical model that describes the **behavior** of a system. It consists of a set of **states**, **transitions** between those states, and **actions** that occur when those transitions happen.

In software design, state machines are used to model the **behavior** of a user interface.

### States, transitions, actions

> Start by identifying the different **states** that your user interface can be in.

For example, a state machine might describe the different **states** of a login screen, such as "logged out," "logging in," and "logged in.”

> Next, define the **transitions** between those states.

For example, the transition from "logged out" to "logging in" might occur when the user clicks the "login" button.

> Finally, define the **actions** that occur when transitions happen.

For example, when the user transitions from "logged out" to "logging in," you might display a loading spinner and make an API call to authenticate the user.

## Why state machine?

It can greatly simplify your logic. If you're dealing with a set of complex rules that determine which action to take next, state machines can help you break those rules down into discrete states and transitions.

A graphical user interface (GUI) can be modeled using a state machine with multiple states and transitions between them. Each state represents a particular screen or view in the application, and transitions occur based on user input and system events.
