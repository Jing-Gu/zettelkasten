**Systematic Program Design (SPD)** is a structured approach to writing programs that emphasizes planning, clarity, and correctness before coding. It is especially associated with the **How to Design Programs (HtDP)** methodology developed by Matthias Felleisen and others

Key ideas behind SPD:
- Start with the problem, not the code
- Follow a step-by-step process

# HtDF (How to Design Functions)
1. Signature, purpose and stub
2. Define examples
3. ... Totally 5 steps

# HtDD (How to Design Data)
Where HtDF helps you design **functions**, HtDD is about **designing the data structures** that functions operate on. It's **step 0** in the Systematic Program Design process — because if your data is badly defined, your functions will be too.

While learning this concept from Edx course, it reminds me [[TDD]], feel similar, and here is the comparison:

- **HtDF is educational**: It’s meant to teach people how to design functions clearly and systematically. It's used in universities (e.g., Northeastern, UBC) to teach programming fundamentals.
- **TDD is professional practice**: Used in real-world software development to ensure code is reliable and testable.
- **HtDF focuses more on data-driven design**, while **TDD focuses more on behavior-driven development**.

**TDD didn’t come from HtDF**, but they both promote **writing tests before full code**, and **thinking before coding**. They're philosophically similar but come from **different origins** — one academic and pedagogical, the other industrial and pragmatic.
