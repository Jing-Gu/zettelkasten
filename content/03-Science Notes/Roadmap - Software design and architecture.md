# Clean code
Writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
One principle says that the code should be organized into small, single-purpose functions and classes, which is opposite from the idea **Deep modules** from [[A Philosophy of Software Design]].

# [[Programming paradigms]]
See Clean Architecture
An effective software uses a hybrid of different programming paradigms at different times.

# [[Object-oriented programming]]
Being one of the programming paradigms, OOP is the clear tool for the architecture. 
Use Model-driven design and domain-driven design to understand:
How object-modelers are able to encapsulate an entire business in a zero-dependency domain model.

# Design principles
With OOP under the belt, design principles help to decide when to use inheritance, when to use abstract class etc.
Design principles are well-established best practices, such as SOLID.

# [[Design patterns]]
Almost all software problems have been solved and categorized, those are called patterns.
3 categories of design patterns: **creational**, **structural**, and **behaviour**. [[Design patterns (Gang of four)]]
Head first design pattern (always heard)

# Architectural principle 
From here, higher level thinking beyond the class level.

# Architectural styles
Complex business models -> Layered architecture
Real-time events -> Publish-subscribe architecture
3 categories of architectural styles are similar to the 3 categories of design patterns, because **architectural styles are design patterns at the high-level**.
Structural
Messaging
## Distributed
A distributed architecture simply means that the components of the system are deployed separately and operate by communicating over a network protocol. The most known might be the client-server architecture.

# Architectural patterns
Architectural patterns explain in details how to implement those architectural styles.
